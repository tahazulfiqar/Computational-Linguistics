a) There are 8 different trees

b)

Replacing the NP grammar rule with NP → NP PP| Det N for the recursive-descent parser causes an infinite loop due to the NP → NP PP.
This occurs at the beginning where NP → NP PP is chosen - which doesn’t lead to any of the lexicons being used. 
Changing the order to NP → Det N | NP PP overcomes the problem for this sentence. 
As a result, ‘the dog’ is categorized with NP →  Det N immediately. 
We are fortunate with the results from this example sentence as Det N is chosen for both instances (the dog/a man), but for a sentence like ‘the dog saw in the park’, it will get stuck in an infinite loop for the ‘in the park’ PP. 
Hence, this is not an adequate solution in general.
